# Easels AI

Welcome to Easels AI, an art generating platform currently in the building stage. This platform is designed for users who are not professional AI prompt writers. Easels AI simplifies the process by allowing users to input prompts in plain language. The input prompt is then enhanced by the AI-text enhancer before being sent to the image generation component, resulting in the creation of unique and personalized images.

**Note: Easels AI is currently in the building stage, and features are subject to change as development progresses.**

## Features (Planned)

- **User-Friendly Prompting**: Users can input prompts in simple language without the need for advanced AI knowledge.
- **AI-Text Enhancer**: Enhances user prompts to create efficient instructions for image generation AI.
- **Image Generation Component**: Processes enhanced prompts to generate unique and personalized images.
- **Tech-Driven Art**: Leverages the power of TensorFlow and GPT API for advanced image generation capabilities.
- **UI Component Library**: DaisyUI enhances the visual appeal and functionality of the user interface.
- **Built with Next.js**: A powerful and efficient frontend framework.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js for a robust and efficient development environment.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow for advanced image generation capabilities.
- **UI Component Library**: DaisyUI for enhanced UI components and visual appeal.
- **AI API**: GPT API for natural language processing and AI prompt enhancement.

## Getting Started

As Easels AI is currently in the building stage, the project is not yet available for local development. Stay tuned for updates on how to contribute and test the platform.
